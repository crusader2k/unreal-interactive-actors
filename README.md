<h1 align="center">Unreal C++ An In-Depth Guide to Creating Interactive Actors</h1>

<p align="center">Demo project for my tutorial about creating interactive actors using C++.<p>

This is the demo project for the tutorial at [Unreal C++ An In-Depth Guide to Creating Interactive Actors](https://robertcorponoi.com/unreal-c-an-in-depth-guide-to-creating-interactive-actors/) which explains how to setup an actor that can have one or more interactive parts which the player can interact with such as opening a drawer or turning on a light.

This demo was created with Unreal 4.25.3

## Instructions

All you have to do is clone or download the repo and open it up in Unreal. Make sure that you load up the MainLevel under Levels/MainLevel and when you hit play you can walk up to the desk and look at the drawer to open/close it or the lamp to turn it on/off.
